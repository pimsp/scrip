TODO's:

Write about functoriality of \Tilde{X}_x^p

Write about how the image of C(\Z_p)_0 \to J(\Z_p)_0 is given by equations linear modulo $p$, and for the right choice of parameters even linear. For the wrong choice: probably just linear and nothing else can be said? Or maybe better?

Generalise 4.12 to deal with calculations modulo higher powers of p. Do this using either
* Newton polytopes, if they exist
* Generalising the proof of 4.12, and work with (I : p^{\infty}) = Z_p<> \cap (Q_p \tensor I). Does that last trick always work? I.e, if Hom(Z_p<>/I,Z_p) is finite, is Z_p<>/(I : p^\infty) a fin. gen. Z_p module? Or maybe less strict: can we always determine this using some finite precision?



Write a remark about the Edixhoven method versus the Coleman method

Write about the Jacobian, and computing J(Z)_0 (complexity?). Maybe Jacobian Varieties by Milne in Arithmetic Geometry, Cornell & Silverman

Write about how to go from mumford rep to Makdisi rep.

Write the example at the end. Maybe treat different primes.
